# Lottery Number Prediction

## About
In the cold of 2015, there was a billion dollar lottery jackpot. I was bored on the train back to San Francisco, so I made this website to just give people
lottery numbers, according to ideas I had on the shape of the "random" number distribution. (So basically, it was just giving you numbers, no insight beyond that).

The site is made with google app engine, python.


##Feature Requests
